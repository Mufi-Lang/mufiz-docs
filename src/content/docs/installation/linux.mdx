## Manual Installation

```bash
# Need to replace {target} with the target triplet of your system
$ wget https://github.com/Mufi-Lang/MufiZ/releases/download/v0.8.0/mufiz_0.8.0_{target}.zip
$ unzip mufiz_0.8.0_{target}.zip
$ sudo mv mufiz /usr/local/bin
$ mufiz --version
```

## Shell Script

You can use the following command to install MufiZ on your system with our official script installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mufi-Lang/installer/main/installer.sh | sudo sh
```

<Card title="Recommend to use Package Manager" icon="information">
    If you are using a package manager like APT or YUM, it is recommended to use the package manager to install MufiZ.
    When a new version is released, the package manager will automatically update the package, so you don't have to manually upgrade
    to the latest version. The script installer is only recommended for users who are using a distribution that is not supported by the package manager,
    and is only able to install the latest version of MufiZ, not see if there is an update available.
