Functions are used to group a block of code that can be executed multiple times. They are declared using the `fun` keyword.

```kotlin
fun foo(){
  // code block
}
```

## Parameters
Functions can take arguments. These are the values that are passed to the function when it is called:

```kotlin
fun add(a, b){
  // code block
}
```

## Return

Functions can return a value using the `return` keyword:

```kotlin
fun add(a, b){
  return a + b;
}
```
